## From locations to images

This is a data preparation program.

You can use the code to convert locations in a trajectory into an image.

The format of your locations should be "id, longitude, latitude".

If the format in your file is different from the above setting, please modify the code correspondingly.

Only one function (**_image_to_loc()**) is provided in the code, which can be invoked multiple times based on your own situation.

*The code will be available soon.*
