# Map Matching Algorithm
This folder includes the HMM-based Map Matching algorithm used to find a continuous route when given a sequence of locations.
To accelerate the processing, we leverage the Quad Tree to split the whole map and use it as an efficient indexing.

To run this algorithm, you need to install some of the python based libraries.
Those necessary packages are listed in the "PackageList" file.

The map used in this algorithm is the map provided in this repository, located at previous layer of folders, which is named as "map.osm".
